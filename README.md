# Memory Game Project

For this project I used Slack Forum and student guidance, Udacity Memory Card Walkthrough by Matthew Cranford, Tutorial by Ryan Waite for guidance.

In addition, this background (background: linear-gradient(160deg, #02ccba 0%, #aa7ecd 100%)) was suggested by a fellow student on the Grow with Google Slack channel.

## Instructions

The starter project has some HTML and CSS styling to display a static version of the Memory Game project. You'll need to convert this project from a static project to an interactive one. This will require modifying the HTML and CSS files, but primarily the JavaScript file.

To get started, open `js/app.js` and start building out the app's functionality

For specific, detailed instructions, look at the project instructions in the [Udacity Classroom](https://classroom.udacity.com/me).

## Contributing

This repository is the starter code for _all_ Udacity students. Therefore, we most likely will not accept pull requests.
